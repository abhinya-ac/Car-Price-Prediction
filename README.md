# Car Price Prediction Project  

## Overview  
The Car Price Prediction Project aims to predict car prices based on various features using different regression models. The project implements data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best predictive performance. 

## Key Objectives:
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships among features and the target variable (car prices).
- Modeling: Evaluate several regression algorithms to determine the best-performing model. The models used include:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Feature Selection: Select the most significant features affecting car prices for model training using statistical techniques.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the parameters of the best-performing model through Grid Search to enhance predictive accuracy.

### Results:
The project systematically evaluates the performance of different regression models and identifies the best approach for predicting car prices. Results are presented in a clear format, highlighting the performance of each model, and providing insights into which features are most influential.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for real-world problems like car price predictions. The insights gained can assist buyers, sellers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions in the automotive market.
